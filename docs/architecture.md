# Construct Architecture

> Required project state. All LLMs working in this repo, including Construct, should treat this as canonical architecture context and keep it current.

## System overview

Construct is a production-oriented orchestration CLI that keeps a stable public surface while routing work through internal specialists, workflows, hooks, MCP integrations, and optional observability/runtime services.

## Core layers

- **CLI surface** — `bin/construct` and `lib/cli-commands.mjs`
- **Workflow state** — `.cx/workflow.json` and `lib/workflow-state.mjs`
- **Domain overlays** — `.cx/domain-overlays/` and `.cx/promotion-requests/` managed by `lib/headhunt.mjs`
- **Retrieval / distillation** — `lib/distill.mjs`
- **Hybrid search layer** — `lib/storage/` (file-state source, SQL-ready store, vector-ready index, hybrid query facade)
- **Runtime health** — `lib/status.mjs`, dashboard API/UI in `lib/server/`
- **MCP integrations** — `lib/mcp-manager.mjs`, `lib/mcp/server.mjs`, `lib/mcp-catalog.json`
- **Hooks / enforcement** — `lib/hooks/`
- **Session persistence** — `lib/session-store.mjs`, `.cx/sessions/`

## Key invariants

- Construct is the only public surface.
- Internal specialists remain implementation details.
- Temporary domain overlays must not auto-promote into permanent capabilities.
- Persistent capability changes require challenge by `cx-devil-advocate`.
- Runtime health, workflow state, overlays, and promotion requests should remain visible in status/dashboard surfaces.

## Public health contract

Construct exposes one canonical machine-readable health slice for current project state:

- `construct status --json`
- MCP `project_context`
- MCP `workflow_status`

These surfaces share the same runtime-defined `publicHealth` contract for active task, workflow/alignment state, and metadata-presence signals. `project_context` is the richer MCP surface for actual context-source details.

### `publicHealth` fields

- `activeTask`
  - `key`
  - `title`
  - `phase`
  - `owner`
  - `status`
- `context`
  - `hasFile`
  - `source` (`json`, `markdown`, `missing`, `invalid`)
  - `savedAt`
  - `summary`
- `workflow`
  - `exists`
  - `phase`
  - `lifecycleStatus`
  - `currentTaskKey`
  - `summary`
- `alignment`
  - `status`
  - `findings`
  - `findingCount`
  - `highSeverityCount`
- `metadataPresence`
  - `executionContractModel`
  - `contextState`

### Semantics

- `activeTask` comes from `.cx/workflow.json` `currentTaskKey` resolution.
- `project_context.publicHealth.context.source` reflects the actual source Construct loaded from `.cx/context.json` or `.cx/context.md`.
- `workflow_status.publicHealth.context` is currently a workflow-scoped view and should not be treated as the canonical source-of-truth for resolved project context details.
- `alignment` is derived from workflow-alignment checks, not inferred from docs or prompt state.
- `metadataPresence.executionContractModel` means the canonical execution-contract metadata object is available on the surface.
- `metadataPresence.contextState` is true when the active context source is `.cx/context.json`.

The intent is parity, not duplication: status and MCP project/workflow tools should expose the same public truth for active task, workflow alignment, and metadata presence, while `project_context` remains the canonical MCP surface for resolved context-source details.

## Release-facing observability boundary

- `construct status --json` is the canonical public health surface for runtime, workflow, context, and active trace-backend state.
- Construct uses Langfuse as the trace backend for all observability: status health reporting, `construct review`, `construct optimize`, and telemetry backfill.

## Domain overlay lifecycle

1. `construct headhunt <domain>` creates a temporary overlay
2. Overlay is attached to existing specialists as bounded scope guidance
3. Overlay can be promoted into a review request
4. Promotion requires architecture + devil's advocate + docs/ownership review
5. Expired temporary overlays can be cleaned up safely

## Session persistence

Sessions are the durable record of what happened during each interaction. They survive `construct down` and enable effective resumption without re-reading full transcripts.

### Design: distilled, not raw

Sessions store only what matters for resumption:

| Field | Purpose | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| `summary` | 2-3 sentence description of what happened | 500 chars |
| `decisions` | Key architectural/design choices made | 20 items |
| `filesChanged` | Paths + one-line reason | 50 items |
| `openQuestions` | Unresolved issues or blockers | 10 items |
| `taskSnapshot` | Task IDs + status (not full descriptions) | unlimited |

Full conversation transcripts, raw tool outputs, and file contents are NOT stored — they are ephemeral or already on disk.

### Storage layout

- `.cx/sessions/index.json` — lightweight array for fast listing (id, project, status, summary)
- `.cx/sessions/<id>.json` — distilled session record

### Lifecycle

1. **Session start** — `session-start.mjs` hook creates a new session and loads the last completed session for resume context
2. **Mid-session** — agents can call `session_save` MCP tool to persist distilled state
3. **Session end** — `stop-notify.mjs` hook marks the active session as completed with a summary
4. **Construct down** — `closeAllSessions()` marks all active sessions as closed

### MCP tools

- `session_list` — list sessions with optional status/project filter
- `session_load` — load full distilled record + generated resume context
- `session_search` — keyword search across session summaries
- `session_save` — update active session with distilled context

## Validation and release expectations

- tests must pass
- docs should reflect shipped behavior
- release/version metadata should be updated intentionally

## Hybrid retrieval model

Construct uses file-state as the canonical source of truth.

- `.cx/context.json`, `.cx/context.md`, `.cx/workflow.json`, and docs are authoritative
- SQL is the shared/team-ready structured store for indexed records and lifecycle data
- vector search is a derived retrieval layer for semantic discovery over selected artifacts

The first implementation slice exposes read-first search and health reporting; write synchronization into shared stores should remain append-only and idempotent when introduced.

### Storage operations

- `construct setup --yes` writes managed vector defaults, starts a localhost-only Postgres container when Docker is available, initializes the shared Postgres schema, and performs an initial sync. Existing `DATABASE_URL` values take precedence.
- `construct storage sync` syncs file-state artifacts into the shared SQL store.
- `construct storage status` reports backend config and reachability.
- `construct search` merges file-state retrieval with any SQL-backed hits available at runtime.
